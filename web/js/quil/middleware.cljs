(defn navigation-3d
  "Enables navigation in 3D space. Similar to how it is done in
  shooters: WASD navigation, space is go up, drag mouse to look around.
  This middleware requires fun-mode.


  Navigation

  * Drag mouse to look around. You can change settings to bind
    mouse-moved instead of mouse-dragged to look around. See
    customization info below.

  * Keyboard:
    * w - go forward
    * s - go backward
    * a - strafe left
    * d - strafe right
    * space - go up
    * z - go down, can't bind to ctrl, limitation of Processing


  Customization

  You can customize this middleware by providing map as
  :navigation-3d option in defsketch/sketch. Map can have following
  optional keys:

  :position - vector of 3 numbers, initial camera position. Default
              is the same as in 'camera' function.

  :straight - vector of 3 numbers, direction you'll be looking at.
              Default is [0 0 -1] (looking down).

  :up - vector of 3 numbers, 'up' direction. Default is [0 1 0].

  :pixels-in-360 - number, mouse sensitivity. Defines how many pixels
                   you need to move/drag you mouse to rotate 360 degrees.
                   The less the number the more sensitive is mouse.
                   Default is 1000.

  :step-size - number, number of pixels you move on each key event (wasd).
               Default is 20.

  :rotate-on - keyword, either :mouse-dragged or :mouse-moved. Specifies
               on which mouse event camera should rotate. Default is
               :mouse-dragged.


  Accessing position information from sketch

  navigation-3d uses fun-mode underneath so all position-related information
  is stored in the state map. It means that you can access in draw/update/any
  handler and modify it if you need to. Position information is a map which
  is stored under :navigation-3d key in the state map. Position consists of
  3 values: :position, :straight and :up. See \"Customization\" section above
  for more details.
